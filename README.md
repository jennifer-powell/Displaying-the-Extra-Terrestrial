# Displaying-the-Extra-Terrestrial



- ## Overview
  - The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. 

- ## Programs, Languages and tools
  - JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js

- ## File overview
  - ### UFO-level-1/StarterCode/static/js/data.js
    ##### Provided dataset
  - ### UFO-level-1/StarterCode/index.html
    ##### HTML template to display web application
  - ### UFO-level-1/StarterCode/static/js/app.js 
    ##### The code that appends a table to the web page and add new rows of data for each UFO sighting. COde allows user to search date and time for sightings. 
  - ### UFO-level-1/StarterCode/static/css/style.css
    ##### Layout of HTML web application
  - ### UFO-level-2
    ##### Code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns.

- ## Steps deployed to reach goal
    - Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    - Made sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.
    - Used a date form in  HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

- ## Findings and conclusion
    - There are many interesting sightings across the United States
